# Bomb Squad: A Quake II mod by Joshua W.
========================================

## Gameplay
==========

You are John Quakeman II, a new recruit for bomb disposal. Your job is to carry the bomb, a live grenade, to the end of each level before detonation! 
You can't use or pickup any other weapons or ammo, so you gotta rely on your quick reflexes and navigational skills to survive!

To help you, enemies do slightly less damage on average and you have a few powerups and abilities at your disposal:

* Sneaker [Default Key: **Q**] : Allows you to sneak past goons 100% unnoticed for 20 seconds! **NOTE:** If you use this powerup *after* an enemy has spotted you, you will still be fired at. This is due to a quirk with Quake 2 and the 'notarget' flag.
* Nuker [Default Key: **E**] : Too many Strogg in your face? Just nuke 'em with the Nuker! A one-time use item that blasts away anything in your immediate vicinity.
* Tackler [Default Key: **R**] : Ever wanted to be like the cool football player knockin down dudes in your path? Use this powerup to instagib any Strogg you walk into! **[WIP]**
* Reflector [Default Key: **V**] : Enemy shots get "reflected" right back at them! Doesn't visually reflect it, but the damage gets applied to them instead of you.
* Laser [Default Key: **F**] : Very self-explanatory. For those few moments in Quake 2 where you need to actually shoot something to progress. **[WIP]**
